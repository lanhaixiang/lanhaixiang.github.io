== About me

I am a third-year PhD student in the [https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/ Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research] at [https://www.columbia.edu/ Columbia University], where I am co-advised by Professor [https://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/ Adam Elmachtoub] and [https://www.columbia.edu/~khl2114/ Henry Lam].
Before joining Columbia, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics from [https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen], where I was advised by Professor [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=en Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo] and [https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangzizhuo/ Zizhuo Wang].
\n 

I am interested in data-driven decision making under uncertainty. Recently I have been working on online resource allocation under cost uncertainty.
